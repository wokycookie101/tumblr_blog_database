# Overview

There are many artists you probably follow on platforms such as Instagram, Tumblr, or Twitter. Have you ever wondered, however, if there were a way to separate these artists in their own little database so that they're not just jumbled in with the other people you follow? Probably not, but I sure have!

I follow, arguably, thousands of talented artists on Tumblr, and with the way Tumblr's set up, it's hard for me to actually keep track of all of them. I could just organize them in excel, but that wouldn't quite be enough, would it? 

Here, I've created a software that can store, update, delete, and list all of the blogs that I've put into it.
